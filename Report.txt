        Bias in Beauty: A Sentiment Analysis of Inclusivity in Makeup
1. What is your topic? Why did you pick it?
The goal of this project is to conduct a Sentiment Analysis on makeup product reviews and explore how the consumers view on inclusivity of certain products. Makeup has been around for thousands of years and yet many brands fail to prioritize inclusivity and accessibility. One of the most common complaints is the inability to cater to darker skintones in foundation,concealer, contour, and blush. It may seem like an irrelevant issue to some but it is rooted in bigger societal battles like social equity and empowering underrepresented people.  Specifically I will focus on a few brands which are known for being inclusive and compare them to brands that have received backlash in the past. I will conduct a sentiment analysis to determine if brands are living up to societal expectations of accessibility and inclusivity. 
2. Research Question
* How does sentiment differ between brands known for being inclusive versus brands that have been criticized for lack of inclusivity.
* Are terms related to inclusivity more common in positive or negative reviews?
