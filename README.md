# Python Final Project: Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores consumer sentiment regarding inclusivity in makeup brands using product reviews. I will compare sentiment between the following brands: Estee Lauder, Tarte, and Bobbi Brown. The analysis includes basic review exploration, sentiment scoring with VADER (SID), and visualization of trends across brands. The goal is to understand how consumers perceive inclusivity in the beauty industry and identify patterns in positive and negative feedback.
 The raw data files I got from Kaggle, were too large to upload on Github, so I have provided the filtered reviews that I have already cleaned. The raw data used can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/dannyperez014/project-5-sephora-products-and-reviews-analysis/input

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- sys
- nltk
- SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
- jupyter (for local execution)

## Installation and Setup

### Local Execution
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lizlemus0811/math120_final_project.git
   cd python_final_project
   ```

2. Install required packages (if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib numpy jupyter
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
   ```

### Google Colab Execution
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload the `notebook.ipynb` file or connect to your GitHub repository
3. Run the first cell to automatically set up the environment

4. Only run the next few cells if you have the original raw data files from kaggle if not start running notebook at the start of the data exploration. 
## Data Description
- **Product Info Data **: Contains product information including:	product_id	product_name	brand_id	brand_name	loves_count	rating	reviews	size	variation_type	variation_value	...	online_only	out_of_stock	sephora_exclusive	highlights	primary_category	secondary_category	tertiary_category	child_count	child_max_price	child_min_price.
- **Product Review Data **: Contains customer reviews including: author_id	rating	is_recommended	helpfulness	total_feedback_count	total_neg_feedback_count	total_pos_feedback_count	submission_time	review_text	review_title	skin_tone	eye_color	skin_type	hair_color	product_id	product_name	brand_name	price_usd

## Analysis Features
- Data loading and cleaning
- Data merging operations
- Summary statistics calculation
- Sentiment analysis using SID
- Data visualization with matplotlib

## Key Learning Objectives Demonstrated
- File I/O operations with pandas
- Data cleaning and preprocessing for text data 
- Data merging and joining
- Statistical analysis and sentiment analysis
- Data visualization
- Function creation and modular programming
- Environment compatibility (local vs. cloud)

## Usage
Run all cells in `notebook.ipynb` sequentially. The notebook will:
1. Set up the environment automatically
2. Load and clean the raw data
3. Filter reviews for selected brands
4. Perform initial data exploration
5. Generate visualizations
